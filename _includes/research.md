    <h3>Organizing Fiscal Capacity 6</h3>

      This paper studies how the allocation of tax agents across the national territory affects fiscal capacity. I evaluate a reform of the Brazilian tax authority that consolidated half of the existing local tax offices. Leveraging regional variation in the reform and newly collected data, I employ a matched difference-in-differences strategy to document how areas served by consolidated offices experience an increase in tax revenues. The reform also led to a divergence in tax enforcement between the core and the periphery of consolidated regions. These results are explained by a trade-off between improved targeting of high-revenue potential areas and increased distance between tax offices and the areas they oversee. These findings suggest that concentrating tax agents in fewer, larger offices increases overall revenues but exacerbates regional inequality in tax enforcement.

      We study the relationship between access to water resources and local violence in Africa. Due to limited irrigation, rural communities rely on rainfall, rivers, and lakes for their economic needs. Rainfall scarcity can make access to water from rivers and lakes more valuable, thereby generating conflicts in rural settings. We explore this hypothesis by integrating granular data on the river network with high-resolution data on rainfall and violent conflict events in Africa from 1997 to 2021. We find that reduced rainfall in a location leads to more conflict in neighboring areas that are water-rich and located upstream along the river network. These are the sites that exert more control over the river flow. The effect is more pronounced in regions experiencing a long-term decline in water presence. Consistent with the proposed mechanism, conflicts concentrate in areas with higher returns to water access, as proxied by the presence of agricultural production. Additionally, the impact is more pronounced in regions with unequal water distribution among ethnic groups, highlighting how cooperation costs are an important friction preventing peaceful sharing of water resources. In terms of policy responses, we find that the effects tend to be mitigated in countries with stronger democratic institutions, better rule of law, higher state capacity and less corruption.

    <h3>Child Labour, Human Capital and Beliefs</h3>

      In contexts where child labour is pervasive, household decisions about allocating children's time between school and work involve a trade-off: current returns from child labour versus future returns from education. This paper tests for the existence of a third factor: future returns from child labour, as parents view farm work as an investment in agricultural skills. We provide evidence on each component of this trade-off in the context of rural Ghana by leveraging four waves of survey data on 5,000 households, exogenous shocks to agricultural productivity, and a vignette survey design to elicit parental beliefs.

    <h3>State Capacity and Environmental Protection</h3>

      Policies against deforestation are crucial for fighting climate change. This paper examines how the governance of environmental agencies affects the effectiveness of these policies. In the context of Brazil, we compile a novel dataset that integrates satellite land use data, administrative data on the environmental agency organization and on agents' career, and enforcement activities. With the findings of this paper, we aim to uncover how governance reforms influence enforcement capacity and shape farmers' land use decisions, contributing to our understanding of how state capacity affects environmental conservation.
