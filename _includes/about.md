I am an economist with interests in development, political, environmental and public economics.<br>

In my research, I leverage quasi-experimental methods, administrative data, large-scale surveys, and geospatial data to study questions related to state capacity, conflict, and human capital.<br>

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Northwestern in 2025.<br>
