I am an economist with interests in development, political, environmental and public economics.

In my research, I leverage quasi-experimental methods, administrative data, large-scale surveys, and geospatial data to study questions related to state capacity, environmental conservation, conflict, and human capital.

I work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at [LEAP Bocconi](https://www.leap.unibocconi.eu). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Northwestern in June 2025. You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/decet_cv.pdf).
