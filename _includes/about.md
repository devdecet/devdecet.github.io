Hello! I study development and environmental economics with a focus on climate change adaptation, gender, and education.  

I am an economist with interests in development, political, environmental and public economics. 

<!-- In my research, I leverage administrative sources, geographucally disaggregated data and surveys to study contemporary questions related to state capacity and the importance of geography and local culture in the explaining the effects of climatic shocks and government policy.  -->

I work as a Postdoc at LEAP-Bocconi. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Northwestern in 2025.
