Hello! I am an economist with interests in development, political, environmental and public economics. 

In my research, I leverage quasi-experimental methods, administrative data, large-scale surveys, and geospatial data to study questions related to state capacity and the importance of geography and local culture in understanding the consequences of climatic shocks and government policy.  -->

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Northwestern in 2025.
